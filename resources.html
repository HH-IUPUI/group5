		<h2>Resources</h2>
		
			<h3>Build a Relationship</h3>
				<p>Navigating relationships in a group project can be challenging in-person. 
				Add different cultures and geographic locations around the globe and it becomes critical to spend time preparing before the project. 
				Incorporating resources that reduce the stress of communicating helps get the project started on the right foot!</p>

				<p>Our website project benefitted from having several pieces in place to get us started. First, a Canvas course provided the background 
				skills needed to jumpstart our website build. We used NameCoach to record our names so we could practice pronunciation prior to our first meeting.
				Our groups were assigned so they were balanced with different cultures. We all started learning about each other at the same starting point.</p>

			<h3>Project Collaboration</h3>
				<p>Our instructors selected tools that worked for members collaborating with web design from all countries. Slack and GitHub both offer free versions with registration. 
				We started with Slack to pull our group together in our own planning space separate from the class. This provided a space to post introductions. 
				However, we realized it was important we have space to share documents for asynchronous comments and a place to meet for discussion and decisions that was synchronous. 
				Our group voted to use Microsoft OneDrive to share documents and Zoom to hold synchronous meetings when needed.</p>

				<p>There are several project planning options online. It was important we select a free resource that was easy to use without a lot of training.</p>

			<h3>Get Started</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://slack.com" style="color:#FFFFFF">Slack</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://zoom.us/signin">Zoom</a></li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Planning</h3>
				<p>While working in our international group we found planning needed to be clear and intentional. If not, meetings may not happen with the different schedules. 
				Things we discovered in the first few discussions. Time zones meant our days and nights were only in sync for a few hours each day. 
				Personally, we also had habits and commitments that needed to be considered. Knowing who is an early bird or a night owl helped us plan meetings where 
				we felt best able to give attention in the Zoom meetings. These are parts of our culture and personality that are not as simple as saying all 
				Americans meet between 8-5 pm.</p>

				<p>Our recommendations are to learn and familiarize in advance what you can with the set items. Understand time zones with online tools like Time Zone Map 
				and understand date formats for different countries. We found in the USA we use MM/DD/YY, whereas in Finland it is DD/MM/YY. 
				Bring patience and a positive attitude to the meetings so the small snafus do not derail the collaborative vibe of the group.</p>

				</ul>

			<h3>Building a Network</h3>
				<p>A lot of time and work are invested in building relationships. Keep momentum going after the class has ended. 
				Spotlight new relationships by connecting through virtual networks. Professionally, LinkedIn is a good place to follow members of the group and share project details with posts. 
				Our class shared LinkedIn profiles. This provided a place to learn about the different professions and skills of the group. 
				We used our new information and early LinkedIn connections to search for motivators that made us want to be part of the global classroom experience.

			<h3>Have Fun</h3>
				<p>Virtually connecting, laughing, sharing our cultures, and seeing each other was the best part of this semester!
				We made virtual meetings more engaging with icebreakers. These helped us start the conversations and improved the comfort of sharing work online.</p>

			<h3>Be Creative</h3>
				<p>Sharing photos and ideas we found online helped us find our look and design. Using websites like SchemeColor.com, Shutterstock and imgur.com 
				provided inspiration to create story boards.</p>
